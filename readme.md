# Assessment 2

This is a assessment i needed to acquire dirty data and make an interactive chart out of the data. What is dirty data? well it's data that is incomplete or has missing values. Which is hard to use out of the box. This assessment is about cleaning the data and using it in a creative way.

## Background

This assessment is to work on the interaction of a chart that uses dirty data. The dirty data you can aquire of recommended links, I used the dirtiest data i could find [from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Eductaion; Goverment spending to education with indication of CBS/OESO](http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&dm=slnl&pa=80393ned&d1=10,12-13,16-18&d2=4,7&d3=a&hd=150105-1327&hdr=g1,t&stb=g2).
